# LightsOutGame
Implementation of a 5x5 Lights Out game using C# with a .NET forms interface. Developed using Visual Studio.

## How to Play
The board consists of a 5x5 grid of lights that are either on (light green) or off (dark green). 
Clicking on a light will toggle it and its adjacent lights (off -> on and on -> off). 
To win the game, all lights must be turned off.

A puzzle will automatically be generated for you when you launch the game. The "New Game" button will also generate a new puzzle to solve.
